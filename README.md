## Hi there, I'm Laura ðŸ‘‹

### About me
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve recently completed a Full Stack Development bootcamp with Command Shift (previously Manchester Codes)
- :computer: I started my coding journey after helping to build an Electronic Patient Record system, where I loved building user interfaces for Healthcare professionals. I started with the Odin Project learning HTML and CSS, and in late 2022 I joined Command Shift's part time course to expand my skillset and knowledge around creating web applications using JavaScript and related technologies. 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my knowledge and understanding from everything I've learnt in the course! 
- :runner: I've previously studied and worked as a physiotherapist in the NHS!
- :sparkling_heart: In my spare time, I love anything crafty, looking after my plants (my favourite is my Alocasia Frydek!) and looking at cute dog videos :dog:
